###Functions
A function is a relationship between two sets of numbers. 
We may think of this as a mapping; a function maps a number in one set to a number in another set. Notice that a function maps values to one and only one value. Two values in one set could map to one value, 
but one value must never map to two values: that would be a relation, not a function.
