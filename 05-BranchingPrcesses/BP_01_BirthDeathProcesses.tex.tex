\subsection*{Birth-death processes}
The birth-death process is a special case of continuous-time Markov process where the states represent the current size of a population and where the transitions are limited to births and deaths.
Birth-death processes have many applications in demography, queueing theory, performance engineering, or in biology, for example to study the evolution of bacteria.
