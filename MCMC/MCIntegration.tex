Monte Carlo Integration
================================== 
In order to integrate a function over a complicated domain D, Monte Carlo integration picks random points over some simple domain D  which is a superset of D,  and checks whether each selected point is within D , and estimates the area of D ( or volume, dimensional content, etc.) as the area of D multiplied by the fraction of points falling within  D.
