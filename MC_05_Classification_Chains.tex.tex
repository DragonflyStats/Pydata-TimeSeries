Classification of Chains
1. Irreducible sets
2. Closed sets
3. Ergodic chains
%========================================================%

\subsection{Irreducible Chain}
An irreducible chain is a chain in which every state is accessible from any other state
in a nite number of steps.

%========================================================%

\subsection{Closed Sets}
A closed set is a subset of states that can not be escaped once entered. An absorbing
state is a closed set composed of one state.


Once either states 3 or 4 are entered, it is not possible to
revert to states 1 or 2. States 3 and 4 will be the only states
visited.
%========================================================%
\subsection{Ergodic Chains}
For Ergodic Chains, the invariant distribution is the vector of
the mean recurrence time reciprocals.
