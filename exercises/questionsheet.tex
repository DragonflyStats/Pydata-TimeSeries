MS4217 Stochastic Processes: Homework 2

%==================================================%
A biased coin is tossed. The probability of a head is $p$. 
The coin is tossed until the first head appears.
Let the random variable $N$ be the total number of tosses including the first head.

Find $\Pr(N=n)$ and its pgf $G(s)$. Find the expected value of the number of tosses.

\[P(H) = p\]

%==================================================%
A probability generating function with parameters $0 <\alpha<1$ is given by

\[G(s) = \frac{1-\alpha(1-s)}{1+\alpha(1-s)}\]

Find $P_n= \Pr(N=n)$ by expanding the series in powers of $s$.
What is the mean of the probability function ${p_n}$?

%==================================================%
the binomial distribution with parameters $r$ expressed in the form


\[pr(N=n) =p_n= \choose{ {r+n-1} {r-1}}=p^r \times(1-p)^n \]
