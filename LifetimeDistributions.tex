What are the basic lifetime distribution models used for non-repairable populations?

A handful of lifetime distribution models have enjoyed great practical success	

There are a handful of parametric models that have successfully served as population models for failure times arising from a wide range of products and failure mechanisms. Sometimes there are probabilistic arguments based on the physics of the failure mode that tend to justify the choice of model. Other times the model is used solely because of its  empirical success in fitting actual failure data. 

Seven models will be described in this section: 

Exponential
Weibull
Extreme Value 
Lognormal
Gamma 
Birnbaum-Saunders
Proportional hazards
